# Year 2 Final Year Project
### This project was the final main project of 2nd year, it was developed over the span of 2 weeks and was built in c++ using SFML for graphics and also THOR for the particle system and for additional timers.
### The game features a main menu with some tutorial tips in the bottom right corner that slowly cycle between hints. The menu also allows the player to change the current character they play as and allows the player to start the game.

### The player can then navigate a world with collisions that are set based on a world grid that is loaded in from a JSON file. A compass in the bottom right points you to the nearest flag to capture and a progress bar shows you how long you have to hold off against the waves of enemies. After capturing all of the flags the game will end. A trail of particles follow the players footsteps as they walk and a trail also emits from the arrows that the player fire. The floating fire enemies also emit smoke particles after they have have been hit once.
